# freelancer-screenshot-app
# An application to moniter the activity of the freelancer you've hired to do your project.

The app is a simple tracking app that makes sure if the freelancer who is being hired by a company or an individual is doing his work. The application takes screenshots periodically of  the software window that is necessary for the task to be performed. For example, if a freelancer is hired to do some photoshop work then the app takes screenshot of the work and sends a low-resolution screenshot to the client so that client pays him for the hours he has spent on working so the client doesnâ€™t overpay or waste his time
